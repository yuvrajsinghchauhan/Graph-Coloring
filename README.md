# Graph-Coloring
Graph colouring is the procedure of assignment of colours to each vertex of a graph G such that no
adjacent vertices get same colour.The objective is to minimise the number of colours while colouring
agraph. The smallest number of colours required to colour a graph Gis called its chromatic number of
that graph.
